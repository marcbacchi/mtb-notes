* https://mtbdatabase.com/bikes/2019/giant/trance/2019-giant-trance-3/
* DriveCasette:
	- 11 – 42 T Shimano Deore
	- FreeHub: Giant / Shimano HG regular freehub
* Wheel HUB:
	- Giant Tracker Performance, Boost 12x148, sealed bearing
	- According to https://www.giantbikespares.com/Giant-FH501B-Freehub--152B-FH501B-501/product_detail/3-43571
	- The freehub is currently FH-501B
* Crank
	- Praxis Works Cadet Boost 30
	- Don't need to do this, its in good condition and it is compatible with new chain ring I want.


Upgrades I wanna do:

* Chain Ring: DONE
	- ~~Absolute Black: Oval 30T~~
	- ~~Ordered and will be installed soon~~
* Cassette:
	- ~~12spd, 10-51T (or 10-52)~~
	- ~~will be getting the SRAM NX 12 spd cassette 11-50T to fit the HG freehub.~~
	- Changed mind to Shimano 12spd cassette, 10 - 51T has better gearing steps ([...], 33, 39, 45, 51)
* Freehub:
	- ~~Not changing out to XD Freehub…~~
	- ~~Staying with HG (Hyperglide) or upgrading to Microspline Freehub (FH)~~
	- Have to upggrade wheelset to MicroSpline to accept new Cassette
	  - Pretty big/expensive upgrade....
* Chain:
	- Need to be compatible with cassette & chain ring.
	- Most expensive one I can find in stock (recommended by Love MTB on youtube)
